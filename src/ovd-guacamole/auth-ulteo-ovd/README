 What is guacamole-auth-ulteo-ovd?
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-auth-ovd is a module to authenticate as Ulteo Open Virtual Desktop
central authentication. OVD auth handles by itself static users, LDAP, mysql 
or AD domains.


------------------------------------------------------------
 Compiling and installing guacamole-auth-ovd
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-auth-ovd is built using Maven. Building guacamole-auth-ldap
compiles all classes and packages them into a redistributable .jar file. This
.jar file can be installed in the library directory configured in
guacamole.properties such that the authentication provider is available.

1) Run mvn package

    $ mvn package

    Maven will download any needed dependencies for building the .jar file.
    Once all dependencies have been downloaded, the .jar file will be
    created in the target/ subdirectory of the current directory.

2) Copy the .jar file into the library directory specified in your
   guacamole.properties

    You will likely need to do this as root.

    If you do not have a library directory configured in your
    guacamole.properties, you will need to specify one. The directory
    is specified using the "lib-directory" property.

4) Configure guacamole.properties for OVD

    # Use LDAP authentication
    auth-provider: net.sourceforge.guacamole.net.auth.ovd.UlteoOVDAuthentication
